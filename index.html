          Have you ever wanted an amazing programer who will be able to code anything you ever wanted? You have one here right now!!
          My name is Ilya Konchenko and in my carrer I will be a proffesional developer. Over the following years I will be hard working on my skills until my goal is achieved. This has been a pretty big dream of mine, being able to create any website I ever wanted is something I have always thought about learning.

Even though I have not yet had the chance to be invloved in any great things during highschool I have great plans for the future and everything is orgonized and laid out. I have tried out and played in many sports outside of school which have taught me very imprtant life skills like teamwork and the ability to think on demand and expressing my ideas to others. All these qualities I have and will keep presenting as well as possible for my team members.</p>

I am going to get as high GPA as possible for all of my highschool years and get into a computer programming collage. This will help me grow my programing knowledge as well as meet very smart people that I can work well together with.</p>
